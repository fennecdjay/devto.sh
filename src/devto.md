# Use bash github actions to (cross-)post to dev.to

I want to start a series a tutorial about [Gwion](https://github.com/fennecdjay/Gwion),
It should be part of Gwion's [doc](https://fennecdjay.github.io/Gwion/).
as well as available on [dev.to](https://dev.to),

[devto.sh](https://github.com/fennecdjay/devto.sh) is a part of this process,
the one that takes a directory of markdown files and publishes the content to [dev.to](https://dev.to).

It is a both a [github action](https://github.com/features/actions)
and a [template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template),
so it should be easy for anyone to reuse :smile:

EDIT: looks like we can add tags
