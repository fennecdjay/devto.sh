# A while ago someone posted ...

Someone posted a [banner generator](https://dev.to/christopherkade/introducing-a-banner-generator-for-your-articles-on-dev-353a)

So I decided I could try it to get cover images for my articles.

# Getting it to work

First I'm posting this.

Then I'll try to add a `cover_image` setting in the front matter.

For this to work I'll have to upload the banner to DEV.

  > Is there a way to do this via API ?

Let's see.
